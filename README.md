# git-extras

Additions to [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive): review a
branch the way a pull request shows it, stage hunks in a vertical diff, and list
open pull requests. With [vim-review](https://github.com/roumail/vim-review),
its review comments go on the branch, are saved per branch and post to the pull
request.

"Main" is the repo's default branch: `origin/HEAD`, else `origin/main`,
`origin/master`, `main` or `master`, resolved per repo when a command runs.
Diffs are against the **merge-base** of `HEAD` and main, so they show only
what this branch changes, not what landed on main since it forked. They
include uncommitted changes.

The `:Branch*` commands show the branch like a PR's tabs on GitHub: its
changed files as diffs, and its commits. They take a
branch, local or remote, to review it without checking it out:
`:BranchDiff origin/feature`.
Diffs are then from that branch's merge-base with main to its last commit.
`<Tab>` completes branches, most recent first. Run `:Git fetch` first to see
new remote branches.

| Command | `<Plug>` mapping | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:DiffThis` | `<Plug>(git-extras-diff-this)` | `:Gvdiffsplit`: index on the left, working tree on the right. `dp` on a hunk in the working tree stages it, `do` in the index unstages it; `:w` the index buffer to keep it. |
| `:DiffThis!` | `<Plug>(git-extras-diff-main)` | The current file at the merge-base on the left, working tree on the right: what the branch changes in it. |
| `:BranchDiff [branch]` | `<Plug>(git-extras-branch-diff)` | One tab per changed file, each already a diff against the merge-base (`:Git difftool -y`), listed in `:Compares`. |
| `:BranchCommits [branch] [args]` | `<Plug>(git-extras-branch-commits)` | Commits on the branch that main lacks (`:Git log base..branch`). `<CR>` on a commit opens it. Extra args go to `git log`, e.g. `:BranchCommits --stat` or `:BranchCommits -- %`. |
| `:DiffClose` | `<Plug>(git-extras-diff-close)` | Close the `fugitive://` windows in this tab and `:diffoff!`. |
| `:Compares` | `<Plug>(git-extras-compares)` | The comparisons `:BranchDiff` opened, newest first (see below). |

Reviewing a PR: check it out (`gh pr checkout`), then `:BranchDiff` and
`:BranchCommits`.

## Comparisons

Each `:BranchDiff` is kept as a comparison, as in GitLens' Search & Compare:
named for the branch (the current branch's name without one), with the
merge-base it diffed against. Its tabs carry its name, so closing the files
that raise no questions leaves the ones that do, and
[vim-prompts](https://github.com/roumail/vim-prompts) can send those with
`#diff_pairs:<name>`. A comparison stays listed until you remove it, even
with all its tabs closed, for the rest of the Vim session; another
`:BranchDiff` of the same branch replaces it.

`:Compares` lists them in a window at the bottom: name, `base..head` (`work tree`
when uncommitted changes are in it), files, how many of its tabs are open,
and age.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `<CR>` | Close the list and open all its files again, in new tabs, against the same merge-base. `:BranchDiff` again to diff against a new one. |
| `d` | Remove it. Its tabs stay open. |
| `r` | Refresh. |
| `q` | Close (`:q` too: the list has its own window). |

## Open pull requests

`:PRs [count]` lists the repo's open pull requests, most recently updated first
(default 20), in a window at the bottom: number, review state (`draft`, `approved`,
`changes`, `review`, or `-`), age, author, branch and title.

Authors' logins can get a readable name beside them, from a file of
`login:name` lines, read on each refresh. The column is left out when the file
doesn't exist, and blank for logins it doesn't name.

```vim
let g:git_extras_pr_authors = '~/.config/gh-pr-authors.txt'  " the default
```

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `<CR>` | `gh pr checkout` the PR and close the list. `:BranchDiff` / `:BranchCommits` review it. |
| `o` | Open the PR in the browser. |
| `r` | Refresh. |
| `q` | Close (`:q` too). |

Defined only when [gh](https://cli.github.com) is installed.

## Review comments

With [vim-review](https://github.com/roumail/vim-review) installed, its review
comments (`:Comment`, `:Comments`, `:CommentsSave`, `:CommentsLoad`) work with
git:

- A comment goes on a file in the work tree or on the branch side of a diff;
  the merge-base side is refused. Paths are relative to the repo root.
- Saves without a file name are per branch and time,
  `vim-review/<branch>/<YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS>.txt` in the git dir, so they
  are never committed and reviews of different branches stay apart.
  `:CommentsLoad` loads the current branch's latest.
- Switching branches with unsaved comments (`:Git checkout`, `:PRs`) warns
  once; `:Comment` and `:CommentsSubmit` warn too. Nothing is cleared.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `:CommentsSubmit [number]` | Post the comments as one **pending** review of `HEAD` on the branch's PR, or PR `number`, through `gh api`. Only you see it until you submit it on GitHub. Refused while any comment's lines are gone (`W` in `:Comments`, see vim-review's anchors). Defined only when `gh` is installed. |

The review is of the commit you read: `HEAD`, so check the PR out (`:PRs`,
`<CR>`) to review it. If the author pushes more before you submit, the
comments stay on that commit, as on GitHub. Comments on a file changed since
`HEAD` are refused, since their lines aren't its; commit or stash first. A PR
that doesn't contain `HEAD` (another branch checked out) rejects the review,
and so does a line outside the PR's diff.

No keys are bound; bind the `<Plug>` mappings yourself, for example:

```vim
nmap <leader>cd <Plug>(git-extras-diff-main)
nmap <leader>cl <Plug>(git-extras-branch-commits)
```

## Install

Requires vim-fugitive; without it the plugin warns once and defines nothing.
`:PRs` and `:CommentsSubmit` also need `gh`, and are left out without it.
Review comments need vim-review.

```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plug 'roumail/vim-review'   " optional: review comments
Plug 'roumail/git-extras'
```
